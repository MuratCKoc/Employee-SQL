## Fake Employee Database
---

A database was created to house the company's information using the pre-existing csvs as guides for the tables within the database. 

### Data model:
![r1](EmployeeSQL/output_images/RDiagram.png)

Some queries were done to ensure the files were loaded correctly. For example:
- The first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

![q2](EmployeeSQL/output_images/2.png)

- List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

Such a strong company

- In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

Then being incredibly nosy, I plotted a graph of the employee salaries. To prove that the data was fake!
